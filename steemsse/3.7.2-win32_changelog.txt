v3.7.2 Features
_________________

Another impressive list of improvements for this release.

- HFE images support

  This is the file format of HxC floppy emulator.
  Copy file HFE_boot.bin to your Steem directory for new disk image 
  creation (though you may use already existing images converted with
  HxC software).

- Improvements in SCP images support

  Ghost disks
  ID around index pulse (I Ludicrus)
  Simpler system for weak bit protections

- Support for 7Z, BZ2, GZ, TAR, ARJ compression formats

  The feature uses ArchiveAccess.dll, which you need to copy to your Steem
  or system directory.
  The included DLL has been fixed by you know who so that it also works
  with BZ2 files. 
  You still need unzipd32.dll and unrar.dll for ZIP and RAR archives.

- New option for crisp Direct3D fullscreen rendering
  
- Links updated in general info; don't forget to copy steem.new
  (feel free to delete the silly brags and mean-spirited Chuck Norris 
  jokes...)
