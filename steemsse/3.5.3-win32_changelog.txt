Improvements of v3.5.3
------------------------

- Reset button inverted: left click for reset, right click for switch off
- On Screen Display: 'Steem SSE' in former plasma, no version number, which 
  is in the window title. In fact 'SSE' fits in the space reserved
  for two digits version number ('3.2'). Nice-looking, original work by Steem
  authors.
- Option 'Interpolated scanlines' moved to SSE option page
- Option 'Slow disk' duplicated in SSE page
- File associations: 
  Can now create and remove association in options.
  Now uses registry part HKEY_CURRENT_USER, not HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT so you
  don't need to run as administrator.
  Simplistic: when you associate, Steem takes the extension for itself,
  disregarding other programss. When you remove the association, Steem deletes
  the extension from the registry.
  No auto-association at startup, including .PRG,.TOS,.APP,.GTP,.TTP.
  No association with .STC (cartridge) possible, by design.
  Removing previous Steem associations is up to you.
  You must reassociate with subsequent versions. It's because the name of the 
  executable changes.
  Those changes also reduce the executable file size by 4KB.
- 'Very large' display size increased to 412x285: The Musical Wonder 90
- 'Large' display size: correct On Screen Display alignment
- TOS STE faster boot (from hatari) (option 'Hacks')
- Better video RAM check on some writes: mmuupd0, 3615 GEN4 by ULM 100%
- Top and bottom borders depend on Wake-up state: wakeup.tos, Decade title, ...
- Shifter destabilisation: 'Bee' demos by LJBK
- Shifter panic: Omega Full Overscan (for fun)
- Shifter tricks fixes for 0 byte lines, lines +2, lines -106, new line +24:
  The LoSTE screens by Sync (STF/STE), SNYD/TCB (WU1,2)
- Hardscroll in high resolution (please code some demos!)
- Bugfix ACIA: Nightdawn
- Bugfix MFP: ST Magazine STE Demo
- FDC: 'Force Interrupt' better handled (Panzer)
- Drive: Slow boot to GEM when no disk; Interleave in 11 sectors disks
