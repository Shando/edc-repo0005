v3.7.1 Features
_________________

- Support for SCP disk images
  
  This is the logical step after STW format, but we had to debug and improve
  WD1772 emulation. At least the structure was OK.
  Some code vaguely inspired by MESS and SPS projects for low level emulation
  of the DPLL (inspection window) and sync timing ($A1 and $C2 marks). 

  All correctly imaged games loading!
  Normally one rev is enough but some games may require 2 revs.
  Weak bits (Dungeon Master) handled only if SSE option 'Hacks' checked.

  (he he)

- Bugfix RAM 14MB no display

- Bugfix PSG noise delays with 'Sampled YM-2149' option (Dungeon Master)
- Bugfix PSG quantize for low periods (Union Demo text screens)
- Bugfix RAR5-compatible version of unrar.dll not recognised. 
- Bugfix Microwire read data (Sleepwalker STE)
- Bugfix floppy disk gaps on READ TRACK (ProCopy on ST, MSA images)
