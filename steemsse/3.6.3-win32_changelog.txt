Improvements of v3.6.3
------------------------

-Gemdos hard disk: interception mode depends on option 'Hacks'
Checked: mode 6 if possible (ReDMCSB)
Unchecked: always mode 4
This is because we're still not sure that ReDMCSB would compile
on a real ST.
-STE DMA sound (option Microwire): YM+DMA only if mixer mode 1
-Adapt Steem to current version of FreeImage (breaking changes)
-No drive led when drive not selected
-Defaults to WU1 for vertical overscan


Bugfixes of v3.6.3
--------------------   

-Bugfix record sound
-Bugfix Shifter write single byte in palette register, revert to
Steem's original way
-Bugfix resume snapshot without CapsImg.dll
-Bugfix save NEO snapshot when FreeImage active
-Bugfix command $D4 in native WD1772 emulation (broken v3.6.2)
