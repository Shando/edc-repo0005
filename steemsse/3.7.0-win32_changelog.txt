v3.7.0 Features
_________________

- Some options have been shuffled about (again), so look around:

  STF/STE switch -> Machine page
  Wake-up state -> Machine page
  Display size -> Display page
  Pasti only for STX -> Disk manager
  Slow disk -> only in Disk manager now (lamer alert!)
  PSG Filter; Drive sound; Keyboard click -> Sound page

- Optional Direct 3D video rendering for fullscreen, probably the most
  important new feature.
  For this you must check the 'D3D' option on the 'Fullscreen mode' page.
  This option should be more compatible with Windows 7 and 8.
  You can choose the resolution among all the 32bit modes proposed by
  your video card (don't clamour for 16bit, if your system can handle DX9,
  it can handle 32bit).

  There's also a new option to emulate the Atari ST's distorted aspect
  ratio in this fullscreen mode. The screen is higher than it should be,
  so that squares and circles ain't.

  DirectDraw modes are still available (if the option isn't checked).

  If you don't need D3D and don't want to upgrade your system just for that,
  a separate build is available, without the option. It's built with Visual 
  Studio 6 and is less optimised than the main VS2008 build, a tad smaller
  too.

- Display
  New options "Lock window size" and "Lock aspect ratio".

- Disk manager
  Double click on nothing goes up one level in the path, like in some 
  file managers.
  Right click on the HD icon to toggle on/off the "Gemdos" hard drive emu.
  "Improved" auto-insert disk B.

- "STW" disk images support
  This format was devised for Steem and holds "clock" bits as well as
  all data and format bytes on the floppy disk, in MFM encoding.
  The goal is to be able to fully emulate the WD1772 floppy drive controller
  also for write commands (write sector, write track = format).
  Notice that it doesn't record timings and so doesn't compete with Pasti,
  Kryoflux, SCP, etc. It is compatible with the Hxc floppy emulator though.
  Support for: Dragonflight; Realm of the Trolls; Union Demo etc.
  A STW version of the Union Demo is included in the download.
  Specification: http://ataristeven.t15.org/txt/STW%20specification.txt

- "STG" ghost disks
  Those are used to harmlessly save high scores, and more, when using
  CTR/IPF/STX disk images, if the option in disk manager is checked. 
  It's a hack, but quite effective.
  Specification: http://ataristeven.t15.org/txt/STG%20specification.txt

- Support for launching standalone PRG and TOS files (see /PRG/note.txt;
  option in disk manager).

- Some emulation improvements
  6301:    More precise mouse speed (we still don't claim perfection)
  68000:   Many prefetch and rounding corrections using the "Yacht" doc
           Some instructions logic fixes:
             ABCD,SBCD, copied from Hatari (Espana 92 -ICS)
             DIV (Speed-Packer II, thx Maartau)
           ILLEGAL assertion conform to real ST for all 16bit opcodes (thx
           Petari)
           Some stack frame improvements in case of bus error (The Teller STX,
           Blood Money -SUP)
           Stop emulation on HALT, indicate in status bar, no more annoying 
           'crash and burn'
  68901:   IACK latency more generally handled (Anomaly Demo)
           Spurious interrupt emulated
           GPIP-IRQ and timeout-IRQ delays (V8 Music System, Overscan Demos 
           STE)
           Write on register delay (Audio Artistic Demo)
           Cycle-accurate timers
  For performance and risk reasons, those MFP improvements are activated by
  the new 'C2' option.
  Advanced: on the SSE page there's a new option that allows you to set
  the CPU clock in relation to the MFP's. It's an interesting variable in
  emulation, it can be used to "fix" some programs.
  Blitter: Timing hack (Relapse Grafix Sound II)
  Drive:   Fix $D8/$D0 confusion (Wipe-Out -RPL)
           Media change for Pasti (4 Wheel Drive/Combo Racer STX)
           Drive sound: you have the choice between two kinds of 'seek' 
           sounds if you right click on the drive icon.
           New hacked pasti.dll is available: 
           http://ataristeven.t15.org/Other_downloads.htm#Pasti
           (Jupiter Masterdrive ,4 Wheel Drive/Combo Racer)
  GLUE:    Correct timings for STE "line +2", this was possible only after
           many CPU/MFP timing corrections, oddly, and could still be
           troublesome. Because of that I accepted those timings only after 
           some tests on a real STE.
  LMC1992: Some fixes, doc is not correct.
  MMU:     Adapt video counter when ST is temporarily set in high res
           (trace routine in My Socks are Weapons by Legacy)
  PSG:     Now the table by ljbk is used for all PSG (soundchip) emulation.
           This makes it louder and quite distorted but that's correct 
           emulation. The ST was a screaming beast, that's why it was
           beloved.
           Need (provided) file ym2149_fixed_vol.bin for this option.
           Bugfix rendering when quantizing high frequency changes 
           (YMT player).
           Addition of a 'Hatari' sound filter, based on... guess what.
  Shifter: Bugfix display "line -2" (BIG Demo #2)
           Read palette returns a value depending on dbus (hack, Awesome 
           04 STF)

- Joystick: you may define a second button for 'up' (jump), for a better 
  arcade feeling on platform games.
  
- Video: nuked AVI recording feature, that wasn't satisfying. Apparently
  some 3rd party software do a better job.

- Patches

  Additionally some new patches hack the password protection of the following
  original games (STX):

  Carrier Command
  Elite
  Great Courts
  RVF Honda
  Starglider II

  They work on the standard STF configuration (TOS102, 1MB).
  Those patches were easily made using the powerful Steem SSE Boiler.
