-safer and more correct triggering of the LOAD interrupt
-Fix Day of Week from clock to be 0-6 - CorComp manual lied ;)
-FIAD disks search entire index sector to work around one form of copy protection (Still technically not the same as TICC, and may fail in particular cases)
-TICC now supports DSK.DISKNAME.FILENAME (not tested on disks other than DSK1)
-removed old bigfilehack filenames and implemented address register read and write (Read untested)
-Allow high ascii as a terminator in filenames
-Fix directory listings that return errors
-Write the Disk DSR buffer header to VRAM. This makes P-Code work with the Classic99 DSR.
-Fix VDP disk buffer header for Corrupt DSK RAM option
-fix EOF flag
-fix off-by-one in header of variable length FIAD files for bytes in last sector
